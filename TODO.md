* add timeout for requests

* url_helper() to remove TDConnection logic

* move __init__ code into another module e.g. core.py

* unit tests

* move more logic into obj.py with standards e.g. object_class() not named classes

* test requests_cache -- did I break something? does not seem to use the cache
