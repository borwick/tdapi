* `move_status.py`: When run, this code moves all tickets in `STATUS_2` to `CLOSED`
  and all tickets in `STATUS_1` to `STATUS_2`. Additional criteria could be added to
  the search to make this move tickets only if they have not been modified recently.
  Note: to use this code you would need to look up your environment's ticketing app
  ID and status value IDs.
